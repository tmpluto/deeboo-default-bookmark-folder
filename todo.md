# Current

- [ ] custom separator??? & update all bookmarks when separator changes to adapt to the new one

- [ ] pinned folders in popup & hide this feature

- [ ] new folder selector maybe with search feature as well (full screen + with pinned folders on top of list)

- [ ] tags & hide this feature

- [ ] maybe css injector to customize ui/hide elements/adding extra classnames to elements for easy targeting or just "Hide Feature X" feature in options

- [ ] light theme???

- [ ] confirm on bookmark deletion???

- [ ] maybe add "add to last used folder" feature ??? if you want it to behave as chrome bookmarking sometimes.

- [ ] rewrite in rust



# More Afterwards

- [ ] switch to either datalist or select with selectedcontent
<br/>WHEN browser compatibility score is high
<br/>datalist supports typing searching filtering the list. BUT DOESNT RENDER ITSELF OUTSIDE OF POPUP HEIGHT IF THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS.
<br/>selectedcontent support fully customizable content screen like radix select
